# Knowledge

A collection of code files created during studying computer science.
It serves as a personal repository for storing code examples, implementations and experiments related to various topics of interest.

My learning progress is being tracked in a [Notion page](https://pricey-trip-c3e.notion.site/d2c7eb82a5294926afc427c468f7dfea?v=7fe7624d48f94214808c40eb2b8dc3a2&pvs=4), where I maintain notes and summaries related to my studies.
